description: "What is Orgax ?   Several years ago Hugo Boogaerts (saxes) and Marnix De Cat (pipe-organ) met eachother on an improvisation-session. This session was recorded and the sound was rather mindblowing : From etheric sound to rough and powerfull ! The mix of both musicians' background makes each concert an exciting adventure to step in !"
